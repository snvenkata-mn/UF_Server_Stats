Before runing unit test:

1. connect to Oracle as system:

    $ sqlplus system/<password_of_system>

2. create user ruby:

    SQL> CREATE USER ruby IDENTIFIED BY oci8;

   or

    SQL> CREATE USER ruby IDENTIFIED BY oci8
       2 DEFAULT TABLESPACE users TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp;

3. grant the privilege to connect and execute.

    SQL> GRANT connect, resource, create view TO ruby;

4. connect to Oracle as sys

    $ sqlplus 'sys/<password_of_sys> as sysdba'

5. grant privileges

    SQL> GRANT EXECUTE ON dbms_lock TO ruby;
    SQL> GRANT CREATE VIEW TO ruby;

6. connect as ruby user.

    $ sqlplus ruby/oci8

7. Create object types

    SQL> @test/setup_test_object.sql

8. change $dbname if the database 

Then you can run:
  $ make check
or
  $ nmake check   (If your compiler is MS Visual C++.)
